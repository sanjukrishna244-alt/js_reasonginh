4.2 Selection Sort
Selection Sort is another simple sorting algorithm that divides the list into a sorted and an unsorted region. It repeatedly selects the smallest (or largest, depending on sorting order) element from the unsorted region and moves it to the end of the sorted region. This process continues until the entire list is sorted.

How Selection Sort Works
Start with an empty sorted region and an unsorted region containing the entire list.
Find the smallest element in the unsorted region.
Swap the smallest element with the first element of the unsorted region.
Move the boundary between the sorted and unsorted regions one element to the right.
Repeat steps 2-4 until the entire list is sorted.
